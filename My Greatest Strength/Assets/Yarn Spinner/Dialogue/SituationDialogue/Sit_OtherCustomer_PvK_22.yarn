    Player: Heyyo, can I help you with your scarf?
    <<animation Chameleon(Clone) Negative>>
    <<expression ChameleonFace Disappointed>>
    Chameleon: Yeah, I can´t reach it. My hands are..small. Normally, it stays in place.
    Player: No worries, I got you!
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    <<animation Chameleon(Clone) Negative>>
    <<expression ChameleonFace Angry>>
    Chameleon: That´s embarrassing.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Noo! I wouldn´t be able to tie this myself too!
    <<animation Chameleon(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression ChameleonFace Neutral>>
    Chameleon: Hmm. True
    You are such an helpful person!

    <<save EventSystem prudence 10>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    <<animation Chameleon(Clone) Negative>>
    <<expression ChameleonFace Angry>>
    Chameleon: This..thing..AGHHHHHHH!

    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    <<animation Chameleon(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression ChameleonFace Happy>>
    Chameleon: I did it!
    I didn´t expect that! You know what you are doing. You let them learn to do it themselves. Sometimes we don´t have someone to help us. Such a thoughtful way!
