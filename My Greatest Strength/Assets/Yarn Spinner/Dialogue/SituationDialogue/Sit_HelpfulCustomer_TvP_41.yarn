    //Helpful Customer
Woow! The smell of fresh lemons! The lemons you wanted came. They are in big boxes and too heavy! The line is also getting longer..

    StoneGolem: You need help with these?
    <<animation StoneGolem(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression StoneGolemFace Neutral>>
    Player: No, I will do them later when the line is less!
    Player: I don´t want customers to wait.
    Player: Thank you!

    <<expression StoneGolemFace Friendly>>
    StoneGolem: Whatever you need.
    That´s very considerate of your customers. Some customers get really angry when they wait longer. Now you don´t have to deal with them. Just do the lemons later.
