Oof, good job! It looks like you have a lot of lemonade fans. Look at the line!
The customers cannot decide and are taking long..even if it is just lemonade. What can you do?
-> Wait for them to make a choice.

    Bat: We cannot decide how many aaaaghh.
    After a while the customers made their order. It is a veeeeryy friendly gesture. I bet you are an amazing friend!
-> Take other orders until they decide.

    Player: How about you take aaaaall the time deciding. I can just take orders from other customers. When you are ready let me know!
    Big brain time! That was so smart. Now you can keep going with your business and other customers donÂ´t have to wait. Everyone is happy! I have to note that..
