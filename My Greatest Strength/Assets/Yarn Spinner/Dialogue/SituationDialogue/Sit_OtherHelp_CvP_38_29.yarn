You learned that the Bat wants to hang out with the Stone Golem but the Bear doesn´t want to. 
The Bear doesn´t know the Stone Golem. But the Stone Golem is all alone. 
-> Suggest that they can play one or two card games together
    <<save Eventsystem teamwork 10>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: I have a plan! 
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: Again..
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Hmm, yeah. So you can play one or two card games together.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: And why is that a good plan smarty?
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Because card games are more fun with more than two people!
    <<animation Bat(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression BatFace Friendly>>
    Bat: Oh, wait. That´s true.
    Bat: Remember the time we got super bored when we played together?
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: Grhh. Not fun.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Exactly! 
    Player: And if you don´t like it you can go, too.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: Grhh..
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    <<expression BatFace Happy>>
    Bat: Yes, we will do that!
    Player: You like the plan Bear?
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: Grhh, I-
    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    <<animation Bear(Clone) Positive>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Bat: He likes it!
    Suggesting games that have to be played with more people was a reaally good idea! 
-> Tell them how you would feel when you were alone and would like to play with others
    <<save Eventsystem gratitude 10>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Player: I would feel very sad when noone would hang out with me.
    <<expression BatFace Friendly>>
    <<animation Bat(Clone) Positive>>
    Bat: Yes, both are my friends. I want to play and chill with both.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: I would be sooo happy when someone played with me. 
    Player: And Bear you don´t know him. Maybe he is suuuper nice.
    <<expression BatFace Happy>>
    Bat: He is suuper cool!
    Player: See?
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: Grhh..
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Play games together!
    Player: He will be suuuper excited to play with such a nice Bear and Bat!
    Player: Give the Stone Golem a chance!
    Bat: We will do that!
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    <<animation Bear(Clone) Positive>>
    Bear: Grh.. fine. Maybe he has some jokes hidden under his stones.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: I bet!
    Explaining how you would feel made the Bear realize that small things make someone veery happy. Nice!
