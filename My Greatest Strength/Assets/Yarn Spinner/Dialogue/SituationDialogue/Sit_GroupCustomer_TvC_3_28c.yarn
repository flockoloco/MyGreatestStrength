    //A group of customers
A group of customers come to your stand. They look very confused. A lot of customers are around, too!
You have to find a way of handling the crowd. 
-> Choose a leader and ask them about the order.

    Player: I am so happy to see a lot of customers here. One of you can take all the orders and tell me after. 
    Everything works out perfectly. Everyone is happy. You prevented a big mess happening. Good job on the teamwork!
-> Give them the glasses and pour it one by one.

    Player: Okay so everyone will get their lemonade very fast! Everyone gets a glass and you hold them up. I am going to pour the lemonade one by one. 
    This was such a smart way of handling the situation! Well done.

    //Customer who needs other help
That was great! You are a real problem solver.
There is still a big crowd. You see customers pushing each other. Your customers struggle to get through with lemonades in their hands. What can you do?
-> Ask everyone to get in one line on the right side and leave from the left.
    <<save EventSystem teamwork 10>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Okay everyone please lets all work together so we do not hurt each other. Make a line on the right side and leave after you get your juicy lemonadyy from the left.
    Customers slowly start to organize themselves thanks to you. Wow!
-> Warn the customers about this behaviour
    <<save EventSystem bravery 10>>
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Player: I know it is sooo hot in here. But please be careful and do not push each other. That can be dangerous. Even for your lemonades!
    Good job! Customers move more carefully after you warned them. That took a lot of courage. You are so brave.
