Bear: You must serve me first!
Player: Ehmm.??? Why?
Bear: I am older than eeeeveryone here!
Player: You just cut the line.
Bear: I know. But I am muuch older. 
-> Ask other customers permission before serving

    Player: Is it okay for you if I quickly give them the lemonade. I think they are a little tired..
    Bear: Well.. I guess. 
    Player: Thank you.
    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    Bear: I just need a little rest.. and a lemonade. Thank you!
    That´s very considerate for both of your customers. 
-> Ask them if they are feeling stressed today

    Bear: NO I would!

    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    Bear: I do! I just.. 
    <<expression BearFace Angry>>
    Bear: My legs hurt. I am not the same anymore. And that´s ANNOYING..
    Player: I understand. Here maybe this lemonade can cheer you up a little. There are good lemons and reeeally bad lemons sometimes. But we still love making AND DRINKING lemonade! 
    Player: Maybe tomorrow there are better lemons around for you. 
    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    <<animation Bear(Clone) Positive>>
    Bear: Maybe.. But this lemonade is yuuuummyyy!
    Sometimes we must ask people how they are. Maybe nobody asked them and they just want to talk. Curiosity teaches us new things about new people we met.
