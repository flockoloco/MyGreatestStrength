    //Helpful Customer
Congratulations! You got a huge order to be picked up soon. You are preparing that order. There are a lot of customers and they also want lemonade. There is not enough lemonade now.
-> Ask your friend Owl for help to make more lemonade and give her free lemonade

    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: Owl, do you want a free lemonade?
    <<animation Owl(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression OwlFace Neutral>>
    Owl: You need my help again, right?
    Player: Yeee!! Pleease..
    <<animation Owl(Clone) Positive>>
    <<expression OwlFace Happy>>
    Owl: Of course! We are a team.
    Player: I don´t have lemonade left. Let´s make some lemonade together?
    Owl: Let´s do this!!
    Asking for help can be hard sometimes. But with a good friend like Owl everything gets easier. See??
-> Tell the customers that you don´t have lemonade left. It will take some time
    <<save EventSystem bravery 10>>
    Player: Heyoo! I´m sorry. The lemonade will take some time.

    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: I will open the stand again when I am ready. 
    Ooff, that was a difficult situation. I am glad you took your time with everything. 
    Sometimes we can say things that make others upset like that.
