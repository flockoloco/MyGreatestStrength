<<expression BearFace Angry>>
Bear: You gave me the wrong change!
Player: What?
Bear: Are you dumb? I said you gave me the wrong change.
Player: I have a diary where I write everything down.
Player: Let me check.
You checked the diary and everything looks correct.
-> Trust your abilities and diary. Defend yourself

    Player: I write eeeverything down and everything is correct.
    <<moodBoard EventSystem angry>>
    Bear: I am bigger than you. Keep that in mind.
    Player: So what? You are still wrong. 
    Player: I trust my abilities and if there where any problems I would give you the money back. 
    OOff. Good thing you defended yourself. That took a lot of courage.
-> Explain again in a nice way

    <<moodBoard EventSystem happy>>
    Player: So I have this diary and I write everything down. I know you are angry but I did everything right. If not I would give you the money back. Trust me.
    Player: Maybe you lost your money?
    <<expression BearFace Neutral>>
    Bear: Hmm. I donÂ´t know, maybe. 
    Player: Can I do anything else for you?
    Bear: No, not now. 
    He was very angry but you handled the situation good and calmed him down.
