That looks like a suspicious customer doesnÂ´t it?

    Player: Hey! I do not like your behaviour. Do not do this here okay? I am working very hard for my bike!
    Yes! There are a lot of customers around to protect you. They would not dare to steal from you ever again!
-> Remind them to pay and tell them it is wrong.

    Player: I think you forgot to pay for your drink. I would appreciate it. I am trying to safe money for my bike. And not paying is toootally wrong!
    They look ashamed. Good way of handling the situation! You explained them what they did is wrong straight away.
